## Dosyago Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs and VARs

Dosyago provides its software under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.

**For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications:**
OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with Dosyago software and do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License (the "AGPL") must enter into a commercial license agreement with Dosyago.

**For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications:**
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the AGPL that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with Dosyago software, Dosyago's open source software licensed under the GPL is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license other than the AGPL, Dosyago makes its AGPL-licensed software available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the those under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the AGPL.

# FAQ

## Q1: As a commercial OEM, ISV or VAR, I have basic questions about the AGPL. Where can I find more information?
A: Go to the Free Software Foundationâ€™s website to read the AGPL. The Free Software Foundation also provides a detailed FAQ on the AGPL.

## Q2: As a commercial OEM, ISV or VAR, I have questions about how to comply with the terms of the AGPL. Where can I find more information?
A: Reading the AGPL itself is the best place to start. Go to the Free Software Foundation's website to read the AGPL. The Software Freedom Law Center has also created "A Practical Guide to AGPL Compliance" with its explanation of the AGPL's requirements.

## Q3: As a commercial OEM, ISV or VAR, when should I purchase a commercial license for Dosyago software?
A: OEMs, ISVs and VARs that want the benefits of using source code, or embedding commercial binaries of Dosyago software in their commercial applications but do not want to be subject to the AGPL and do not want to release the source code for their proprietary applications should purchase a commercial license from Dosyago. Purchasing a commercial license means that the AGPL does not apply, and a commercial license includes the assurances that distributors typically find in commercial distribution agreements.

## Q4: What is Dosyago's dual license model for its software?
A: Dosyago makes its software available under both the AGPL and a commercial license. As a result, developers who use or distribute open source applications under the AGPL can use the AGPL-licensed Dosyago software, and OEMs, ISVs and VARs that do not want to combine or distribute the Dosyago software with their own commercial software under an AGPL license can purchase a commercial license.

## Q5: What open source licensing options does Dosyago offer for its software?
A: Dosyago makes its software available under the AGPLv3, plus an additional permission for included software under other licenses.

For some of its client-side software that runs on a client (as opposed to server-side software) Dosyago adds the further additional permission of the Universal FOSS Exception, allowing a qualifying FOSS application to use them without subjecting the entirety of the application to the reciprocal license requirement of the AGPLv3. (See the License Information for each unit of Dosyago software for license information specific to that software, including the terms and conditions of the GPLv3, the additional permission for included software under separate licenses, and the Universal FOSS Exception.)

## Q6: What is Dosyago's commercial license for its software?
A: Dosyago offers a commercial license for all of its software that is embedded in or bundled with another application. The commercial license allows OEMs, ISVs and VARs to distribute commercial binaries, or services, of its software with their own commercial software and services without subjecting that software and services to the AGPL and its requirement to distribute source code.

## Q7: If I have more questions, whom should I contact?
A: For more information, please contact [Cris](mailto:cris@dosycorp.com?subject=Sales).
